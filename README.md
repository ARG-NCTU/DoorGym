# DoorGym

## Clone repo and Docker

I released docker images for developers that can modify other packages on this and compile by yourself.

### Step1. Clone repo

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:ARG-NCTU/DoorGym.git
```

### Step2. Docker run

Run this script to pull the docker image to your workstation.

```
source docker_run.sh
```

### Step3. Docker join

If you want to enter the same docker image, type below command.

```
source docker_join.sh
```

### Step4. Catkin_make

Execute the compile script at first time, then the other can ignore this step. 

```
source catkine_make.sh
```

### Step5. Setup environment

Make sure run this command when the terminal enter docker.

```
source environment.sh
```

## Download dataset and knob model

This dataset is required for both training and evaluation, you can follow below command to download these. 

```
cd world_generator
python3 download_data.py
```

If you want to make your own dataset, you can follow below steps.

### Step1. Lever and Round knobs

#### [Lever knobs](https://github.com/PSVL/DoorGym/releases/download/v1.0/leverknobs.tar.gz) (0.77 GB)
#### [Round knobs](https://github.com/PSVL/DoorGym/releases/download/v1.0/roundknobs.tar.gz) (1.24 GB)

### Step2. Setup knob and robot model

* Extract the downloaded door knob dataset under the `world_generator/door` folder.
* Place your favorite robots under the `world_generator/robot` folder. (Blue robots are there as default)

### Step3. Generate door world (e.g. pull knob and husky ur5 combination.)

```
cd ~/DoorGym/world_generator
python3 world_generator.py --knob-type pull --robot-type husky-ur5
```

Check the model by running the mujoco simulator

```
cd ~/.mujoco/mujoco210/bin
./simulate [environment path]
```

More detailed instruction [here](./world_generator)

## Training and evaluation

Before ready for the above setting, then you can train a model or evaluate a pre-trained model. For the training and evaluation are need parameter setting, I arrange it and write a script that is easy to use.

### Training

* Pull task

  ```
    source train_pull.sh
  ```

* Push task

  ```
    source train_push.sh
  ```

### Evaluation

* Pull task

  ```
    source run_pull.sh
  ```

* Push task

  ```
    source run_push.sh
  ```

If you want to train or evaluation baseline (DoorGym) or 6 joints environment, you need to edit training and evaluation script.

For the trainging or evaluation

  Edit train_pull.sh (run_pull.sh) or train_push.sh (run_push.sh) parameter.

  * DoorGym baseline
  
    ```
    --env-name doorenv_gym-v0
    ```

  * 6 joints
  
    ```
    --env-name doorenv_6joints-v0
    ```

  * 3 DOF

    ```
    --env-name doorenv-V0
    ```
